/**
 * Volatile keyword:
 *
 * The instance variable is declared volatile to ensure that changes made by one thread to the
 * instance are visible to all other threads. This is important for thread-safety in a multithreaded environment.
 *
 * First check (without synchronization):
 *
 * The first if (instance == null) check is done without synchronization. This is to avoid the performance cost
 * of acquiring a lock every time getInstance() is called
 *
 * Synchronized block:
 *
 * The synchronized block ensures that only one thread can create the singleton instance at a time. Itâ€™s executed
 * only if the instance is null, so it prevents multiple threads from entering this block simultaneously.
 *
 * Second check (within synchronization):
 *
 * The second if (instance == null) check is inside the synchronized block. This ensures that no other thread
 * has created an instance between the first check and acquiring the lock. This is the core of the double-checked locking technique.
